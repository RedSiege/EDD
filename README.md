# EDD
Enumerate Domain Data is designed to be similar to PowerView but in .NET. PowerView is essentially the ultimate domain enumeration tool, and we wanted a .NET implementation that we worked on ourselves. This tool was largely put together by viewing implementations of different functionality across a wide range of existing projects and combining them into EDD.

	customldapquery - Set arbitrary LDAP filter to search for objects
	getuserdacl - Returns DACL of a specified domain object
	getnetlocalgroupmember - Returns a list of all users in a local group on a remote system
	getdomaingroupmember - Returns a list of all users in a domain group
	getdomainuser - Retrieves info about specific user (name, description, SID, Domain Groups)
	getdomaindescriptions - returns domain objects with non-standard account descriptions
	getnetsession - Returns a list of accounts with sessions on the targeted system
	getnetloggedon - Returns a list of accounts logged into the targeted system
	getuserswithspns - Returns a list of all domain accounts that have a SPN associated with them
	getdomaingroupsid - Fetch the SID of a group
	getdomainsid - Fetch SID of domain
	getsiddata - Return username from SID
	joingroupbysid - Join an account to a group via the group's sid
	joingroupbyname - Join an account to a group via the group's name

### Chained Information
	findadminsch - Uses the task scheduler to query for admin rights within a domain
	findadminwmi - Uses WMI to search for admin rights within a domain
	finddomainprocess - Search for a specific process across all systems in the domain (requires admin access on remote systems)
	finddomainuser - Searches the domain environment for a specified user or group and tries to find active sessions (default searches for Domain Admins)
	findemptysystem - Searches the domain for systems with no user account logged into it
	findinterestingdomainsharefile - Searches the domain environment for all accessible shares. Once found, it parses all filenames for "interesting" strings
	findwritableshares - Enumerates all shares in the domain and then checks to see if the current account can create a text file in the root level share, and one level deep.
